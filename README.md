# SoccerAI
SoccerAI is a domain-restricted conversational chatbot designed to answer only soccer-related questions.
It leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) through LangChain, combined with Natural Language Processing (NLP) filtering techniques to prevent off-topic responses.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate how LLMs can be controlled and specialized for a single domain—in this case, soccer making the system more focused, reliable, and safe for end users.

This project was developed as a Senior Project for the Computer Science program.
